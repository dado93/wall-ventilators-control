# Wall Ventilators Control
So, I decided to install a wall mechanical ventilation system in my house. The problem is that each unit of the system must be controlled separately, and so I have to control them one by one through their remote controller. I have decided to design and develop a system able to control the units remotely, either via web, via a mobile application or through a central hub, offering also the possibility of having some sort of automation. In this repository you will find all the code related to this project.
