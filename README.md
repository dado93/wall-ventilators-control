# Wall Ventilators Control
Earlier this year I decided to install a wall mechanical ventilation system in my house. The problem is that each unit of the system must be controlled separately, and I have to control them one by one through their own remote controllers. I have decided to design and develop a system able to control the units remotely, either via web, via a mobile application or through a central hub, offering also the possibility of some sort of automation. In this repository you will find all the code related to this project.

## Components
- ESP8266
- BME280
- IR Transmitter

## Compatible hardware
At the moment, the system is compatible with ESP8266 boards.
